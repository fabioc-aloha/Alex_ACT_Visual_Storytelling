# ASCII Chart Gallery

An ASCII counterpart to a chart gallery. Every form below is organized by
the same seven communication goals used by Illustrator's `chart-vocabulary`
skill, so the two compose: pick the goal there, render it here when the
target is a terminal, a log file, a pull request, or a context window.

Figures marked **real** are computed from [`datasets/sales-sample.csv`](../datasets/sales-sample.csv).
Figures marked **illustrative** use shaped data because the sample has no
funnel or process structure; the form is the point, not the numbers.

Regenerate with `pwsh -NoProfile -File demo/build-gallery.ps1`.

+--------------------------------------------
units ->       o low cost    O mid    @ high cost

### Not viable in ASCII

| Form | Why | Use instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pie, Donut, Sunburst | angle encodes the value, and a character cell cannot carry a partial angle | Stacked 100% bar, Percentage rows, or Waffle grid |
| Violin, Density | a smooth curve needs sub-character resolution that a monospace grid does not have | Histogram or Box plot |
| Streamgraph | stacked curved baselines become unreadable once each band is quantized to whole cells | Small multiples |
| Connected Scatter | a path between arbitrary points needs line segments at arbitrary angles | Slope chart for two periods, Line chart for a series |
| Regression fit | the fitted line lands between cells at most angles, so the slope reads wrong | Scatter plot with the coefficient stated in text |
